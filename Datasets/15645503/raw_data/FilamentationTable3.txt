Table 3. Summary of genes required for yeast filamentation 	 			
				 
Gene 	ORF 	Known function 	Reference for its role in PH 	 
ABP1 	YCR088W 	Actin binding protein. May stabilize actin filaments at the bud site and may share a role in the cortical actin patch assembly. 	This study 	 
BNI1 	YNL271C 	Protein involved in cytoskeletal control. Stimulates actin filament assembly and regulates microtubule-dependent nuclear migration through actin cytoskeleton	(Mosch and Fink, 1997) 	 
CAP2 	YIL034C 	Actin capping protein. Promotes faster and more extensive actin assembly 	This study 	 
PEA2 	YER149C 	Involved in orientated growth toward mating partner, required for stimulation of the low-affinity Ca2+ in flux system that is activated in response to mating pheromone and is required for cell-cell fusion 	(Sheu et al., 2000) 	 
SPA2 	YLL021W 	Protein involved in cell polarity and cell fusion during mating. Involved in haploid invasive growth and pseudohyphal growth. Involved in mating projections 	(Mosch and Fink, 1997) 	 
TPM1 	YNL079C 	Encodes a tropomyosin protein localized to actin cables. Plays a role in assembling or stabilizing actin cables	(Mosch and Fink, 1997)	 
BUD2 	YKL092C 	GTPase activating protein for Rsr1p/Bud1p. Involved in bud site selection and may act as a target of the Cln2p-Cdc28p kinase to regulate cell polarity	(Rua et al., 2001) 	 
HUF1 	YOR300W 	May be involved in bipolar budding and bud site selection 	This study 	 
ECM25 	YJL201W 	Encodes a protein that is possibly involved in cell wall structure or biosynthesis 	This study 	 
GAS1 	YMR307W 	Glycoprotein that regulates the cross-linking of Beta-1,6-glucans in the cell wall 	This study 	 
PRS3 	YHL011C 	Component of the yeast 20S proteasome. Has a role in cell wall and cell cycle regulation	This study 	 
RPL21A 	YBR1401 	Encodes ribosomal protein L21. Reverses the repression of ribosome synthesis in response to a secretory pathway deficiency 	This study 	 
RPL34B 	YIL052C 	Encodes ribosomal protein L34. Reverses the repression of ribosome synthesis in response to a secretory pathway deficiency 	This study 	 
SEC66 	YBR171W 	Component of ER protein translocation complex 	This study 	 
ILM1 	YJR118C 	May be involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance 	This study 	 
UGO1 	YDR470C 	Required for mitochondrial outer membrane fusion and mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Has a role in cell cycle progression in stressed cells 	This study

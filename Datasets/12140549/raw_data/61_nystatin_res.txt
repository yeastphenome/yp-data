Dispensable for premeiotic DNA synthesis, double strand breaks, synaptonemal complexes, and heteroduplex formation, but generally required for completion of meiotic recombination. RAD52 controls the level of a 72 kd endo-exonuclease in log phase and sporulation. Interacts with Rad51p by two hybrid analysis. mRNA is induced in meiosis during recombination.

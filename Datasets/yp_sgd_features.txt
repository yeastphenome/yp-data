6592	S000087160	YGL194C-A				Putative protein of unknown function; identified based on comparisons of the genome sequences of six Saccharomyces species; SWAT-GFP and mCherry fusion proteins localize to the endoplasmic reticulum
6593	S000087203	YCL048W-A				Putative protein of unknown function; SWAT-GFP and mCherry fusion proteins localize to the cell periphery and vacuole; YCL048W-A has a paralog, YDR524C-B, that arose from the whole genome duplication
6594	S000087209	YDR461C-A	CMI8	Cytosolic MIni protein of ~8 kDa		Putative cytosolic protein of unknown function
6595	S000113553	YDR374W-A	WIP1	W-lIke Protein		Kinetochore localized protein of unknown function; interacts with Cnn1p (CENP-T); orthologous to human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-W and fission yeast new1
6596	S000113555	YDR119W-A	COX26			Subunit of cytochrome C oxidase complex; stabilizes or regulates formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes composed of Complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)
6597	S000113557	YDL007C-A				Putative protein of unknown function
6598	S000113559	YKL023C-A	MIN9	mitochondrial MINi protein of 9 kDa		Mitochondrial protein of unknown function
6599	S000113563	YKL065W-A	DPC7	Delta-Psi dependent mitochondrial import and Cleavage protein of 7 kDa		Putative mitochondrial protein of unknown function; SWAT-GFP fusion protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) while mCherry fusion localizes to both the ER and vacuole
6600	S000113566	YLR146W-A				Putative protein of unknown function
6601	S000113587	YIL102C-A				Putative protein of unknown function; identified based on comparisons of the genome sequences of six Saccharomyces species; SWAT-GFP, seamless-GFP and mCherry fusion proteins localize to the endoplasmic reticulum
6602	S000113589	YPR145C-A				Putative protein of unknown function
6603	S000113613	YDR014W-A	HED1	High copy suppressor of rED1		Meiosis-specific protein; down-regulates Rad51p-mediated mitotic recombination when the meiotic recombination machinery is impaired; promotes synapsis and required for the normal morphogenesis of synaptonemal complex; prevents the recruitment of Rad54p to site-specific DNA double-strand breaks in vivo; early meiotic gene, transcribed specifically during meiotic prophase
6604	S000122558	YPR010C-A	MIN8	mitochondrial MINi protein of 8 kDa		Mitochondrial protein of unknown function; SWAT-GFP, seamless-GFP and mCherry fusion proteins localize to the cytosol; conserved among Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
6605	S000178054	YCL054W-A	RDT1	Ribosomally Detected Transcript		Short open reading frame, shows evidence of translation; may be new protein-coding gene that originated de novo from noncoding sequence; same allele found in at least 33 other S. cerevisiae strains; at least 3 strains have a second allele with three nucleotide substitutions leading to two amino acid differences
